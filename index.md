## About Me

Hi! I'm Miguel, a PhD Researcher in social robotics and intelligent systems, actively contributing to the TrustAT project. In this role, I am dedicated to developing autonomous agents capable of trustworthy collaboration with humans. In addition to my research endeavors, I am an invited teaching assistant at IST, imparting my expertise in the courses of social robotics and planning, learning and intelligent decision making. My PhD focused on developing models for decision making, capable of highlighting an autonomous system’s intentions during interactions between humans and artificial agents. 

PhD researcher passionate about Artificial Intelligence and interactions between humans and autonomous enitities. My research focuses lies at the intersection of robotics and machine learning, where I specialize in leveraging cutting-edge techniques of reinforcement learning with explainable AI and system transparency to significantly augment the communication capabilities of robots and intelligent agents. During my PhD, I focused on developing models of decision making that better highlight the underlying system's intentions, using notions such as legibility, when interacting with humans.

In addition to my academic pursuits in research and teaching, I passionately delve into the world of photography as a hobbyist, actively engaging in various photography communities and proudly seeing my work featured in esteemed publications. Fuelled by my love for music, I embarked on a personal journey to master the guitar during my college years.
